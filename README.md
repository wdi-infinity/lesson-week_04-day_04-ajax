# AJAX

## HTTP Recap

Let's define a few terms:

- *server*: A server is software that processes HTTP requests and builds responses to be sent back to a client.
- *client*: A client is software that makes HTTP requests and processes a server's response.
- *request*: A message sent to a server which requests a document.
- *response*: A message sent to a client which contains a document.
- *protocol*: A rule or set of rules defining proper communication.
How is the web different than the Internet?

The Internet is a telecommunications network. All telecommunications networks—from telegraphs, through phone and radio, and to teletype—facilitate transmission of data from one point to another.

The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply "web") is a distributed, world-wide collection of documents transmitted over the HTTP protocol.

- A client sends a request to a server.
- The server processes the request.
- The response gets sent back to the client.
- The client processes the response.

Examples:

- GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345
- GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders
- GET http://www.example.com/buckets/sample

## JSON

JSON is:

- a data exchange format.
- a way to represent data.
- a string with a specific format.

JSON is not:

- a dictionary.
- an object.
- an object literal.

JSON does not support:

- comments.
- methods.

Here is an example of JSON data:
```json
{
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Smith",
     "address": {
         "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
         "city": "New York",
         "state": "NY",
         "postalCode": 10021
     },
     "phoneNumbers": [
         "212 555-1234",
         "646 555-4567"
     ]
 }
```

## API

Let's check out a few API's

- [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
- [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/)
- [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [Game of Thrones API](https://anapioficeandfire.com/)

[We can add a chrome extentsion to make JSON easier to read](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)

## AJAX

AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

AJAX is not a programming language.

AJAX just uses a combination of:

- A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
- JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

AJAX allows developers to:
- Read data from a web server - after a web page has loaded
- Update a web page without reloading the page
- Send data to a web server - in the background

AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.

AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

Let's take a look at a few sites that use AJAX:

- https://www.google.com/maps
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wAtHJh3lMwQxfZ3Uqtow6KNd06h2OSJJ0mXH0b-R6Xo/edit

What would happen if we disabled javascript and tried to use those sites?

We make AJAX requests with 
- [JS XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest)
- [JS Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- [jQuery AJAX](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- many other helpful AJAX libraries

## Axios

### Request
- method
    - GET
    - POST
    - DELETE
    - PATCH/PUT
- url
    - https://swapi.co/api/people/1
    - https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2
- data (optional)

*Get Request Example*
```js
axios({
  method: 'get',
  url: 'https://swapi.co/api/people/1'
});
```

*Post Request Example*
```js
axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: 'https://swapi.co/api/people/1',
  data: {
    firstName: 'brunos',
    lastName: 'ilovenodejs'
  }
});
```
### Response Object

- *data*: the payload returned from the server. By default, Axios expects JSON and will parse this back into a JavaScript object for you.
- *status*: the HTTP code returned from the server.
- *statusText*: the HTTP status message returned by the server.

### Error Object

- *message*: the error message text.
- *response*: the response object (if received) as described in the previous section.
- *request*: the actual XMLHttpRequest object (when running in a browser).

### Handling Responses

Since an AJAX call is asynchronous, we need to handle its response in a particular way.  

You may have already used some asynchronous javascript with `setTimeout()`.  Potentially you ran into a problem with it.  

[Let's take a look at how asynchronous javascript works!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

To work with asynchronous javascript, we are going to use promises and a promise chain.

```js
// Example 1
axios({
  url: 'https://dog.ceo/api/breed/boxer/images/random',
  method: 'get',
}).then().catch() // .then and .catch are chained at the end of the request 
```

It is easier to ready if we place them on the next line
```js
axios({
  url: 'https://dog.ceo/api/breed/boxer/images/random',
  method: 'get',
})
.then() // .then wants a function to run if the request is succesful
.catch() // .catch wants a function to run if the request is succesful
```

The `.then` and `.catch` method want us to pass them functions to run.
`.then` wants a function to run if the request succeeds 
`.catch` wants a function to run if the request fails
```js
axios({
  url: 'https://dog.ceo/api/breed/boxer/images/random',
  method: 'get',
})
.then(doGoodStuff) 
.catch(doErrorStuff) 
```

We often use anonymous, fat arrow functions.
```js
axios({
  url: 'https://dog.ceo/api/breed/boxer/images/random',
  method: 'get',
})
.then(() => {
    // code for if the request succeeds
}) 
.catch(()=>{
    // code for if the request fails
}) 
```

`axios` will pass our functions the `response` or `error` object so that we can access the data that the API returns to us.
```js
axios({
  url: 'https://dog.ceo/api/breed/boxer/images/random',
  method: 'get',
})
.then((response) => {
    // code for if the request succeeds
    console.log(response)
}) 
.catch((error)=>{
    // code for if the request fails
    console.log(error)
}) 
```
